                <h2>The History of Beauty Hub</h2>
                <section class="history-content">
                    <p>In 2005, in one of the largest metropolises in Europe, two friends, Emilia and Laura, founded the Beauty Hub company, combining their passion for fashion and cosmetics. They wanted to make self-care accessible and enjoyable for everyone, creating a center where the most innovative and high-quality products could be found under one roof. In 2007, the first store opened, which immediately attracted attention with its modern interior and unique assortment, providing customers not only with the opportunity to buy, but also with an atmosphere in which everyone could find something for themselves.</p>

                    <p>As Beauty Hub grew in popularity, the assortment began to expand: in 2010, organic cosmetics were added and an online store was launched, making the products available to customers from other cities and countries. In 2015, the company presented its own line of cosmetics, developed with the participation of experts, which allowed it to offer unique formulas and eco-friendly packaging. By 2018, Beauty Hub had expanded into international markets, opening new stores in major cities in Asia and North America, and introducing a loyalty program for regular customers.</p>

                    <p>Throughout its journey, Beauty Hub has actively used modern technologies and approaches. In 2023, the company integrated augmented reality into the online store, allowing customers to virtually try on cosmetics. Today, in 2024, Beauty Hub continues to evolve, focusing on innovation, quality, and customer care, striving to inspire people to take care of themselves and express themselves.</p>
